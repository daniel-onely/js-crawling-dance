With regards to the music, samba involves a syncopation that creates a sense of suspension, and this, as described by American cultural critic Barbara Browning: leaves the body with a hunger that may only be satisfied by filling the silence with motion. As can be seen below, whilst the dancers Brenda Carvalho and Anderson Mendez da Rocha don't step on count four, the hips continue to move and for that reason fill that count.", "The following is one version of the footwork for samba no p, which is samba danced individually. There are various versions of the footwork. Here it's shown with a back accent, and not travelling. The hips fall on the side of the functioning leg, which is achieved by calming the corresponding knee. In the 30s another type of samba emerged in Rio de Janeiro and became a popular social dance in the 40s samba de gafieira, frequently referred to as simply samba."]
